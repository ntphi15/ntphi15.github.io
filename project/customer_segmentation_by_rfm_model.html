                <h4>What is "Customer 360"?</h4>
                <p>Customer 360 is a Customer Relationship Management platform. This platform constructs a 360-degree view of customer data by aggregating all relevant information about that customer. Customer 360 enables businesses to extract value, achieve sustainable competitive advantages, and maximize customer opportunities across multiple channels.</p>
                <p>Customer 360 helps businesses understand their customers. From there, they can deliver superior customer experiences and ensure their competitive advantage.</p>

                <h4>About "RFM Model"</h4>
                <p>RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a model for analyzing and segmenting customers based on their consumer behavior characteristics using historical transaction data. Specifically, RFM stands for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Recency:</b> How long ago was the customer’s most recent transaction? A longer time since the last transaction indicates a higher likelihood of customer churn, meaning the company will need more time to re-engage and retain them. Conversely, a shorter time indicates better opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.</li>
                    <li><b>Frequency:</b> How often does the customer transact with the business? Customers who make frequent purchases are more likely to respond to brand campaigns and become loyal customers. For example, weekly or monthly buyers are more likely to be receptive to upselling compared to those who buy once every three months.</li>
                    <li><b>Monetary:</b> What is the total amount of money the customer has spent on the brand within a specific time frame? Spending behavior indicates where the customer’s spending power lies. Based on this and transaction frequency, you can calculate the average spending per transaction. Typically, customers who have made multiple purchases and trust the brand are more likely to make high-value purchases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>RFM segmentation helps evaluate the customer journey from various angles and provides answers to questions such as:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Who are the high-spending and most loyal customers?</li>
                    <li>Which customers are likely to churn?</li>
                    <li>How can we increase regular purchases?</li>
                    <li>Which customers have the potential to convert to higher spending?</li>
                    <li>Which customers have the potential to convert to higher spending?</li>
                    <li>Which customers need nurturing and retention efforts before they become churned customers?</li>
                </ul>                  
                <p>Segmenting customers based on RFM can help evaluate customers from various perspectives and factors. Simultaneously, it aids in crafting tailored messages, campaigns and incentive programs for each customer group based on their consumption behavior with the goal of driving future revenue growth. Therefore, marketing activities based on this approach have the potential to increase response rates and enhance customer retention, satisfaction and overall value.</p>

                <h4>RFM score calculated with SQL</h4>
                <p>First of all, we need to calculate per customer how many days have passed since the last order (Recency), how many orders they have placed (Frequency), and the monetary value they generated (Monetary Value). To conduct RFM analysis, let’s see how we can score these customers by ranking them based on each RFM factor separately. Let’s begin with ranking customers on recency first and score all customers from 1-4.</p>
                <p>We have sorted customers by recency, with the most recent purchasers at the top. Once the numbers are sorted, you will separate your customer data into quartiles, 4 equal groups of 25%. The top 25% of customers receive a recency score of 1, the next 25% a score of 2, and so on. Similarly, we can then sort customers by frequency from most to least frequent, assigning the top 25% a frequency score of 1, etc. For the monetary value, the top 25% of customers will be assigned a score of 1 and the lowest 25% a score of 4.</p>
                <p>After we have sorted and assigned scores to each factor, you will be able to determine each customer's RFM score by combining each individual score. There are up to 64 different combinations of RFM scores. The report shows how many customers are assigned to each score combination and we provide the following predefined RFM statuses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Top Customers</b> (RFM score <i>"111"</i>): Most valuable customers:  made the highest amount of purchases, with the least days since last order and the highest monetary value;</li>
                    <li><b>Loyal Customers</b> (RFM score <i>"x1x"</i>): Customers that made a great number of purchases. This segment does not indicate performance regarding days since the last order or monetary value;</li>
                    <li><b>High Potentials</b> (RFM score <i>"xx1"</i>): Customers that made had a great AOV along their lifecycle. This segment does not indicate performance regarding days since the last order or number of orders in their lifecycle;</li>
                    <li><b>Small Buyers</b> (RFM score <i>"x13"</i> or <i>"x14"</i>): Customers that place few orders will have a small monetary value. This segment does not indicate performance regarding days since the last order;</li>
                    <li><b>Dormant Customers</b> (RFM score <i>"44x"</i>): Customers that placed few orders a long time ago. This segment does not indicate performance regarding the monetary value of those orders;</li>
                    <li><b>Worst Customers</b> (RFM score <i>"444"</i>): Customers that placed few orders, a long time ago, with small monetary value.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Customers who do not fall under the specifications above will be categorized as <b>Other</b>. All customers are assigned an RFM score; however, not all scores have a predefined RFM status.</p>

                <p>According to RFM statuses, we divide customer into 7 groups. The majority of the "Other" customer group accounts for more than half of the total current customer base. There are 97,566 "High potential" customers, representing 15.69%. Next in line are "Small buyer", making up 12.35%. The remaining groups all fall below 10%, with "Top customer" positioned near the bottom ahead of "Worst customer".</p>
                <p>The revenue from the "Other" customer group accounts for nearly one-third of the total company revenue. Despite "Loyal customer" group ranking third, the revenue generated from this group actually holds the second position, trailing behind the "High potential" group. The revenue generated by "Worst customer" group is at its lowest, while the number of customers in this group also occupies the least position compared to the total customer count.</p>

                <p>The 1st and 5th area are the two highest revenue-generating areas, primarily because they contain the two largest cities in the country, namely Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Additionally, south provinces, which fall under 6th area, have numerous industrial zones and a high demand for shopping, resulting in this region’s third-place revenue position. The demand for shopping by residents in the western provinces and north-eastern provinces is not high; Therefore, the revenue from these regions is not high either.</p>

Ho Chi Minh City leads in terms of "High potential" customers, but it also tops the list for "Worst customer". In this case, Hanoi is the city that leads in terms of the number of "Top customer". In addition, Dong Nai and Binh Duong provinces, which have a significant population and numerous factories, always come after the two major cities.</p>

                <h3 class="resume-title">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>To maintain and continue growing "High potential" customer base, businesses should consider policies that enhance the value of each order. Specifically, when customers sign up as members, they can enjoy benefits during their birthday month, fixed discounts on each order, or additional rewards based on accumulated membership points1. Retaining existing customers and attracting new ones are crucial for sustained business growth.</p>
                <p>For “Small buyer”, even though they make frequent purchases, the value of their orders remains quite low. This customer segment is relatively large, so consider implementing policies that bundle additional products at discounted prices when they purchase items with lower value. By doing so, you can enhance the overall value of each order and cater to the needs of this customer group.</p>
                <p>"Loyal customer", who consistently make purchases, the value of their orders remains high. This customer segment is quite substantial. To cater to their needs, consider offering sample products as gifts and allowing them to experience new items in the store. Although their repeat purchase rate is high, it’s essential not to be complacent and continue nurturing this customer group.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, in the smaller provinces of the northern and western regions, not only is the customer volume low, but the value of individual orders is also not high. The reasons for this could be that these areas have limited exposure to businesses, and the shopping demand is not yet substantial. To address this, businesses may consider implementing strategies such as offering discount codes for shipping, promotional campaigns, or deep discounts on specific products. These efforts can help promote business information to the residents in these regions.</p>
                <p>Businesses can shift their focus towards investing in advertising campaigns, bringing their products closer to customers by introducing exclusive product information and cutting-edge technology during development and production. Businesses should have and focus on market research sessions to understand preferences and needs, which helps modify products in a positive direction that aligns with technology and customer usage purposes. Simultaneously, they should continue to thoroughly explore and optimize the items that users are already familiar with through research and development methods, ensuring that their products maintain a strong position in the market.</p>
